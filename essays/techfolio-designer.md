## The Problem

My experience so far with [TechFolios](https://techfolios.github.io/) was overall positive. I was first introduced to TechFolios in my Software Engineering I (ICS 314) class when I had to create a TechFolio for myself. In the beginning, there were a few challenges. Because TechFolios are hosted using GitHub pages, that meant that I needed to know how to use a little bit of Git and GitHub. At the time, I was completely new to Git and GitHub and I did not really use either of them before creating my TechFolio. Entering the information for my bio was a little challenging and it took a little trial and error to figure out the correct formatting for the JSON file. Writing essays using markdown was also something that was new to me.

As time went on, I was able to familiarize myself with all of the tools needed to develop a TechFolio. I also discovered many things to aid in the development of my TechFolio. I currently build a local version of my TechFolio on my computer whenever I'm making changes. This allows me to see more detailed error messages and I also don't have to wait ~5 minutes for my site to build on GitHub. Whenever files are changed, they are almost immediately updated in my local build. I also use Atom along with a package for previewing markdown to see my formatted essays as I write them.

## The Solution

Having a desktop client that can combine all of these helpful tools that I use to create a TechFolio could be helpful for people who are also interested in developing their own TechFolio. Having a desktop client would decrease the barrier to entry for creating a TechFolio. Instead of saying to download and install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and [Markdown Preview Plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus), one could just say to download and install the TechFolio Designer application to get started with creating a TechFolio.

This summer, I plan to work with a few other people to create a desktop client using the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) framework that solves some of the problems with creating a TechFolio.
