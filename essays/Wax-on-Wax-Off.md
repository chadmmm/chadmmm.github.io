<H2>Wax on, wax off?</H2>

In the movie, The Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi tells Daniel to "wax on, wax off". Daniel went to Mr. Miyagi to learn Karate so he is wondering why this old man is making him wax his car. Daniel later finds out that the movements of applying and removing wax transferred over to Karate moves. The lesson of this is that people often have a lot of enthusiasm about the end goal instead of having enthusiasm about the journey to the end goal. There is a lesson in almost everything.

<H2>How does "wax on, wax off" relate to software engineering?</H2>

There are some people that get into software engineering because they hear that they have the possibility of making a lot of money. This is the end goal. What these people do not realize is that it takes a lot of work to become successful. In order to be the best, you need to keep up with all of the latest programming languages and other technologies. Everything is changing so often in the field of software that in order to be successful, you need to be constantly learning new things.

<H2>Learning by questioning</H2>

Questions can be a valuable resource for learning. A well formulated question or a "smart" question can benefit both the questioner and any other person that views the discussion that was provoked by the question. One of the first steps to formualating a "smart" question is to do research to make sure that the question has not already been answered. Most questions don't even need to be asked, because there is a lot of information out there. If the answer to the question cannot be found, then the question could be well formulated so that it will encourage a good response. Simply asking a question that has little effort put into it will often times lead to a low effort answer. More information about forming a good question can be found in Eric Raymond's essay, [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
