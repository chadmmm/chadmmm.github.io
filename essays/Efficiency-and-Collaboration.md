What is software engineering? To be honest, I do not really know much about it and it seems like a great reason to take a software engineering class; so that is what I am currently doing. I was first introduced to programming only a year ago and I feel like I have learned so many things about writing code since then. The problem is that I do not know a lot about how all of the pieces fit together to create a final product. I have learned about how to write a program and things such as user interfaces and testing code have come up briefly in previous classes, but I still do not know a lot about the entire workflow of engineering software.

I intend to develop efficient methods that create great software. In a previous class, there was a guest speaker that came in and told us the importance of being efficient when writing code. One thing that really stuck with me is that he told us that by setting the entire function key row of our keyboard as a shortcut to compile in an IDE, we will be able to save large amounts of time. When I thought about it, the thinking really goes along with the mindset when developing algorithms. Although there is only a difference of seconds between clicking the compile button and mashing the top function key row on the keyboard, the time wasted using a mouse to click compile will add up over time. This idea is similar to how almost any sorting algorithm will take a reasonable amount of time with a small data set, but differ largely in time once the data set becomes larger. Because software engineering focuses on more than just writing code, I am interested in developing an efficient workflow that works for me when engineering software.

I would also like to work on collaborating more with other people. Something that I realized early on in my career as a student of computer science is that, other people can often offer a different perspective on things because they might take a different approach to thinking. Critiquing and collaborating with other people always strengthens my work because other people can point out weaknesses and I can work to improve on those weaknesses. In the end, collaboration is a win-win for both parties because it promotes stronger work.
