<H2>Configuration Management and Pyramids</H2>

The Egyptian pyramids are looked at as one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind. The Great Pyramid was the largest man-made structure until the Eiffel Tower was built about four thousand years later. Large-scale software projects can be compared to a pyramid. It would be insane to say that a single person was able to write all of the code required to operate the Google search engine that exists today. With each large scale projet, there needs to be some kind of organization otherwise the project will turn to chaos. This is where configuration management comes in. 

<H2>Past experiences with group projects</H2>

In the past, I have had to work on group projects where all of the group members had to share the source code throuhg a series of emails with attachements. One of these projects was the Minesweeper game that can be found on my Projects page. At the time, none of my group members knew how to use Git inclduing me so we decided to divide up the work by assigning specific functions to work on to each group member. The group quickly ran into many problems because almost all of the functions relied on each other to work. We ended up partially completing all of the functions and then attempting to make them fit together. This caused more problems, because people were editing parts of other functions and it was difficult to tell what was edited and what was not. In the end, we decided that it was best to have only one person work on the code at a time and once they were done, they would send a copy off to the next person to complete their part. Although the group struggled more than it had to with merging code, we were able to successfully finish the project and be satisfied with it. I think that everyone in the group learned from this experience, the importance of some kind of configuration management.
