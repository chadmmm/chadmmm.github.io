<H2>Summary</H2>
This project was one of my summer projects that I worked on and it is still a work in progress. Instead of doing everthing at the same time, I have been adding new elements over a long period of time. The reason for doing this project is to improve connectivity within my house and to also have a central area where I can back up my important data. For the networking side of things, I replaced my old netgear wifi router with a separate router, switch, and wireless access point. I also replaced my rented cable modem with one that I purchased. My house has also been wired up with ethernet calbes that to go rooms with computers. As far as data storage goes, I configured a network attatched storage and a backup hard drive. 

<H2>Cable Modem</H2>
Previously, I rented a cable/router combo from my internet service provider, which was an Arris DG1670A pictured below.

I calculated that for the price that I had to pay to rent the modem, I could purchase my own modem and it would pay for itself in roughly a year. I decided to purchase an Arris SURFboard SB1683 cable modem.
