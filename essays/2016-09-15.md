<H2>Introduction</H2>

Based on my past experiences, it seems like some sort of configuration management practices are necessary in order to work in groups for software development. In one of my classes, the final project was a group project. None of the group members knew how to use any sort of configuration management software so we had to develop a system of sending zip attachments in emails to each other. Although it was possible for more than one person to work on the code at a time, it was difficult to merge all of the new code together when the work was done. In the end, the group was able to complete the project, but I feel that the use of some kind of configuration management would have saved a lot of time.
