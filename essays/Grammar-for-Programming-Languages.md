##Introduction

A programming language is essentially a langauge that is used to communicate instructions to a computer. There are many programming languages, but like other human languages, there is never a mention of using proper grammar. The grammar in programming languages comes in the form of coding standards. A person can know how to speak a certain language, but if they don't use proper grammar, it may be hard to understand them. The same purpose of grammar in human langauges, also applies to programming languages. People who know the person who wrote the code and their style of coding may be able to understand the code, but it can be difficult for other people to understand. The readability of code becomes even more important when working collaboratively on a software project because the project needs to be readable by everyone working on it. Coding standards ensure that these large software projects will have uniform formatting.
